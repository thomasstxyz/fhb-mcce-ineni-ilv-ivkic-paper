## Development environment with Vagrant/Virtualbox

Install [Oracle Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and
[Hashicorp Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) on your machine.

Create your VM with Vagrant.

    vagrant up

Open a shell to your VM.

    vagrant ssh

Now, inside the VM, navigate to `/vagrant`, which is 
where the current directory is mapped.

    cd /vagrant

Before continuing with the deployment in the next section, 
setup your `~/.aws/credentials`
and your private SSH key.

## Deployment

### Terraform

- Set the name of your EC2 key pair name

for Windows PowerShell:

    $env:TF_VAR_ssh_key = "my_key_pair"

for Linux/MacOS:

    export TF_VAR_ssh_key="my_key_pair"

- Apply Terraform

```
cd terraform
terraform apply
```

This will create EC2 instances and write their public ip addresses into the file `ansible/inventory`.

### Ansible

- Run Ansible Playbook

```
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory main.yml
```
