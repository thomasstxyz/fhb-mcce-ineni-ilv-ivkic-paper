## topic ideas

- Kubernetes Storage: Ceph vs. Gluster vs. NFS
- Kubernetes Container Runtime: Docker vs. containerd vs. CRI-O
- Self-hosted and self-managed
DevOps platform (incl. CI/CD/CD) on Kubernetes
- Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Deployment
- Multi region storage replication: block, file, object
- Simple, but complete self-hosted DevOps platform (CI/CD pipeline)
- HA K8s cluster design for on-premise
- service mesh for legacy applications w/out containerization
- performance comparison: plain vs. encrypted internal K8s network
- MicroK8s vs. K3s vs. K8s performance
- self contained small scale HA kubernetes cluster with k3s
- Nginx LB Performance: Native Linux vs. Docker single node vs. Docker Swarm vs. Kubernetes
- Performance of On-Premise Active-Passive Load Balancer w/ Keepalived vs. K3s Cluster based Load Balancer

- Mixed CPU architecture environments (ARM/Intel/AMD)
  - Load balencing across systems with different CPU architectures
  - Deploying programms across different architectures
  - Benefits of using different Architectures
    - Reusing old Hardware 
    - Green It
    - Using low cost hardware for Low priority/minor load tasks
