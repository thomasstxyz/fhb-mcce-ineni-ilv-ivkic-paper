\subsection{ARM architecture}

\citeauthor{maqbool2015evaluating} 
state that in their benchmarks,
ARM performed four times better on single core workloads and
2.6 times better on four cores, 
regarding performance to power ratio.
On memory intensive database transactions however, 
x86 performed 12\% better for multithreaded query processing
\cite{maqbool2015evaluating}.
