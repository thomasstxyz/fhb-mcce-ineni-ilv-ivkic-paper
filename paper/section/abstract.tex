The goal of this paper is to introduce the idea of potential energy savings by using heterogeneous clusters.
Different types of processors can provide advantages in certain use cases while showing lower performance in other tasks. 
By effectively exploiting the strengths of the processors used and thus increasing their effectiveness, it should be possible to save energy in the operation of the software. 
For the research on the energy-saving potential of heterogeneous clusters, an experiment is conducted. 
In the experiment, benchmarks are performed on devices with different processor architectures, and the power consumption is measured to calculate the energy efficiency of the tested task.
A heterogeneous cluster prototype is built to demonstrate the feasibility and limitations that arise during the process. 
The results should provide further information about the usefulness of heterogeneous clusters for saving energy.
